# Gcode README
These files are gcodes kept in this folder for backup purposes. No gcodes in this folder are guaranteed to work on your printer, as they are sliced for my Prusa.
If you want to print these files, use the 3MF folder instead. It has all the necessary modifications to print well. These files will also likely be not up-to-date.
