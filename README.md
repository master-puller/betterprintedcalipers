# betterprintedcalipers
### Designed in FreeCAD
This project attempts to solve the downfalls of regular 3D printed calipers regarding flex, smoothness of motion and repeatability. I won't pretend that this will be a perfect pair of calipers (If you want some, Mititoyo!), but this should be "good enough" for most measurements.

This design is meant to be used like vernier calipers, but you print your own scales, which allows printers that aren't super dimensionally accurate to create this. Side note: this can possibly also serve as a slide rule with the correct scales

Backlash is eliminated with the use of recirculating ball bearings embedded in the calipers, with adjustable spacing.
