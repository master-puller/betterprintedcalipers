I've wanted to do this project ever since I saw several attempts at 3D printed calipers, all of which said that this was a novelty. I didn't want for it to be that way, and I decided to create an instrument, that once calibrated, is worthy of your trust. 

These had various downfalls, from having too much backlash, to not being reliable in measurements, I'm attempting to address these features and make a reliable tool that costs pennies to create. (Meaning: You can abuse them like all the other cheap calipers you have been doing) This project stems from the DPI of 2D printers, which allows for very accurate graduations and distances.

As an upside of the approach incorporating ball bearings, the calipers require less force to move than a comparable set of steel calipers (which may or may not be undesirable)

Hardware: Copied from BOM.MD
x2 M3x5 Screws
x2 M3x5 Square nuts (Included with Prusa Spare parts)
x60 3/32" ball bearings (BRING MANY MORE!)


##Guide to printing:

1. Please use at largest a .4mm nozzle. You could do it, who's stopping you, but I don't recommend it at any larger
2. Printing external perimeters first may improve tolerances, you will have to redo any print calibration
3. Print all the parts at 50% layer height or less. My recommended value is .15 mm, as it gives a good balance between speed and quality (for this application)
4. Print the calibrator first! Then set the value of XY offset for all the parts and print. Tolerance coins may be useful at guesstimating, but vertical print compensation is not included.
